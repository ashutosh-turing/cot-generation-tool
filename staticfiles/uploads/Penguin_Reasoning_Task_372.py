# A Gym tracks how many members stay and refer others: 60% of members stay if they attend 1-2 classes per week, and 80% stay if they attend 3 or more classes per week. Each month, 10% of members refer new members to the studio. The studio gains 5 new members every month, and 2% of members leave each month. Simulate with Monte Carlo how the number of members grows over 12 months, and calculate the 90% confidence interval for the total increase in membership after 12 months.

# **[SECTION_01]**
# 
# In this section, we will define the key variables and parameters that we need to set up the simulation. These are crucial because they determine the structure and behavior of the entire simulation.

# **[atomic_01_01]**
# 
# Before we start, I need to establish the main inputs for the simulation. These are the factors that will influence how the gym membership evolves over time. For example, I know the retention rate is based on attendance—60% for those attending 1-2 classes per week and 80% for those attending 3 or more. These probabilities will be important for modeling the retention of current members. Also, I will need a dropout rate to account for natural member loss, set at 2% per month. This will give me the flexibility to simulate both retention and loss.

# **[atomic_01_02]**
# 
# Additionally, we have a monthly referral rate of 10%, meaning 10% of the current members will refer new members every month. I also know the gym will gain 5 new members each month, independent of referrals. This fixed growth rate ensures the gym's membership will continue to increase over time. These additions are essential to simulate the dynamics of how the gym attracts new members.

# **[atomic_01_03]**
# 
# I also need to decide on the duration of the simulation, which will run for 12 months. This gives me a concrete time frame to observe how the membership evolves. The more simulations I run, the more accurate my confidence intervals will be, so I choose to perform 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations. This should help me understand the potential variability in the gym’s growth and capture a range of possible outcomes.

# **[atomic_01_04]**
# 
# Now that I have my parameters defined, I can represent them in code as variables. I'll create variables for the initial membership, retention rates, dropout rate, and fixed member growth. Then, I’ll store the number of simulations and months to iterate over.
# 
# ```python
# # Key Parameters for the Simulation
# initial_members = 100  # Initial number of members
# retention_rate_1_2 = 0.60  # Retention rate for members attending 1-2 classes
# retention_rate_3_plus = 0.80  # Retention rate for members attending 3 or more classes
# dropout_rate = 0.02  # 2% dropout rate
# referral_rate = 0.10  # 10% of members refer new members each month
# fixed_new_members = 5  # 5 new members added each month
# simulation_months = 12  # Simulation duration in months
# num_simulations = 10000  # Number of Monte Carlo simulations
# ```
# 
# With the key parameters in place, the next logical step is to model the retention and dropout process for each member.

# ---

# **[SECTION_02]**
# 
# In this section, I will model how member retention and dropout are handled each month. We will account for members leaving due to the fixed dropout rate and for members staying based on their attendance probabilities.

# **[atomic_02_01]**
# 
# To start, I need to decide how to handle each member’s retention. Members either stay or leave based on their attendance frequency. Those attending 1-2 classes per week have a 60% chance of staying, while those attending 3 or more classes have an 80% chance. This means that I must categorize the members into two groups based on their attendance, and for each group, I’ll simulate whether they stay or leave by comparing a random number to their respective retention probabilities.

# **[atomic_02_02]**
# 
# However, I also have to account for a 2% natural dropout rate, meaning that regardless of attendance, 2% of the members will leave each month. To do this, I’ll combine the retention probabilities with the dropout rate. In this way, every member has a chance of leaving due to the natural dropout, even if they attend classes regularly. I’ll implement this by randomly determining if each member stays or leaves each month, based on both their attendance probability and the fixed dropout rate.

# **[atomic_02_03]**
# 
# To simulate this, I’ll use a random number generator for each member. For example, if a member attends 1-2 classes, I will generate a random number between 0 and 1 and check if it is below 0.60 (60% retention). If it is, the member stays; otherwise, they leave. For the natural dropout, I'll apply the 2% chance to all members, regardless of attendance.

# **[atomic_02_04]**
# 
# Here's a basic code snippet to model retention and dropout for each member:
# 
# ```python
# import random
# 
# def simulate_retention(members, attendance_type):
#     retained_members = []
#     for member in members:
#         if attendance_type == "1-2":
#             retention_probability = 0.60
#         else:
#             retention_probability = 0.80
#         
#         # Check if the member stays based on retention probability
#         if random.random() < retention_probability:
#             retained_members.append(member)
#         
#         # Check if the member leaves due to natural dropout (2% rate)
#         if random.random() < 0.02:
#             retained_members.remove(member)
#     return retained_members
# ```
# 
# With the retention and dropout process modeled, the next step is to handle member referrals and the addition of new members.

# ---

# **[SECTION_03]**
# 
# In this section, I will model how referrals and new member additions contribute to the gym’s growth each month. Referrals will be based on a 10% rate of current members, and the gym will gain 5 new members every month.

# **[atomic_03_01]**
# 
# First, I need to account for referrals. Every month, 10% of the current members will refer new members. I’ll calculate how many members will refer others by taking 10% of the total number of retained members. Then, I’ll simulate the number of new members referred by each existing member. I can assume that each referring member brings in one new member, but I might also use a probabilistic distribution like Poisson if I want to model variability in the number of referrals per member.

# **[atomic_03_02]**
# 
# In addition to referrals, the gym will gain a fixed number of new members every month—5 new members, regardless of the referral activity. This means that I will add a fixed number of new members to the gym’s total membership each month, regardless of the number of referrals. Together, these two sources—referrals and fixed new members—will contribute to the overall growth.

# **[atomic_03_03]**
# 
# I’ll calculate the total number of new members each month by combining the referrals and the fixed additions. I also need to ensure that the number of new members doesn’t exceed the total number of referrals available (i.e., 10% of the current membership). If I wanted, I could also apply additional probabilistic rules here, but for simplicity, I’ll start by assuming one new member per referring member.

# **[atomic_03_04]**
# 
# Here's a code snippet that models how new members are added each month through referrals and fixed additions:
# 
# ```python
# def add_new_members(members):
#     # Calculate the number of members who will refer others (10% of current members)
#     num_referring_members = int(len(members) * 0.10)
#     
#     # Add new members from referrals
#     new_members_from_referrals = num_referring_members
#     
#     # Add fixed number of new members (5 per month)
#     fixed_new_members = 5
#     
#     # Total new members for the month
#     total_new_members = new_members_from_referrals + fixed_new_members
#     return total_new_members
# ```
# 
# With both member retention/dropout and new member additions modeled, the next step is to run the simulation over 12 months, tracking membership growth across many Monte Carlo iterations.

# ---

# **[SECTION_04]**
# 
# In this section, I will simulate the gym’s membership growth over 12 months. We’ll loop through each month, applying retention, dropout, referrals, and new member additions, and repeat the entire process for multiple iterations using the Monte Carlo method.

# **[atomic_04_01]**
# 
# Now that I have modeled member retention, dropout, and new member additions, I can simulate how the gym’s membership will evolve each month. I will set up a loop to run this process over 12 months. Each month, I’ll update the number of members by considering the members who stayed (based on retention and dropout), adding new members from referrals and fixed additions, and then updating the membership count.

# **[atomic_04_02]**
# 
# For each simulation, I’ll start with an initial number of members. Then, for each of the 12 months, I’ll apply the retention and dropout rules, update the membership with the number of new members (both from referrals and fixed additions), and record the new membership total at the end of the month. This will be done for each of the 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations to simulate various possible outcomes.

# **[atomic_04_03]**
# 
# I will keep track of how the membership changes each month, storing the results after the 12-month period. For each simulation, I want to capture the final membership count to analyze the overall growth and variability. This way, after running all simulations, I can examine the range of membership increases across all iterations.

# **[atomic_04_04]**
# 
# Here’s how the code will look for running the Monte Carlo simulation over 12 months:
# 
# ```python
# def run_simulation(initial_members, months=12, num_simulations=10000):
#     results = []
#     for _ in range(num_simulations):
#         members = initial_members
#         for month in range(months):
#             # Apply retention and dropout
#             members = simulate_retention(members, attendance_type="1-2")  # or "3+" depending on your model
#             # Add new members from referrals and fixed additions
#             new_members = add_new_members(members)
#             members += new_members
#         results.append(len(members))  # Store the final membership after 12 months
#     return results
# ```
# 
# By running this simulation multiple times, we can then analyze the outcomes and move forward with confidence interval calculations. But first we need to store and analyse these results.

# ---

# **[SECTION_05]**
# 
# In this section, I will focus on storing and analyzing the results across all Monte Carlo simulations. After each simulation run, I want to track the final membership count and compute the increase in membership compared to the initial number.

# **[atomic_05_01]**
# 
# To start, I need to record the final membership count at the end of each simulation. Since we are running multiple simulations (10,000), each iteration will give us a different outcome based on the initial number of members and the random processes like retention, referrals, and new member additions. After every iteration, I will store the final membership count to analyze how the membership has evolved after 12 months.

# **[atomic_05_02]**
# 
# Once I have the final membership counts from all simulations, I need to calculate the increase in membership for each simulation. This is simply the difference between the final membership count and the initial number of members. By doing this, I can focus on how much growth occurred, which is the key metric we're interested in.

# **[atomic_05_03]**
# 
# After calculating the membership increase for each simulation run, I will store these increases. The purpose is to understand the distribution of possible outcomes and how the growth fluctuates across different runs. This will give me insight into the variability in membership growth over time and the potential for both lower and higher outcomes.

# **[atomic_05_04]**
# 
# Here’s how I will collect and store the results:
# 
# ```python
# def run_simulation(initial_members, months=12, num_simulations=10000):
#     results = []
#     for _ in range(num_simulations):
#         members = initial_members
#         for month in range(months):
#             # Apply retention and dropout logic here
#             members = simulate_retention(members, attendance_type="1-2")  # or "3+"
#             new_members = add_new_members(members)
#             members += new_members
#         # Store the membership increase (final count - initial count)
#         results.append(members - initial_members)
#     return results
# ```
# 
# By storing these increases across all simulations, I can now proceed to calculate the confidence interval for the membership growth.

# ---

# **[SECTION_06]**
# 
# In this section, I will compute the 90% confidence interval for the membership growth based on the results of all simulation runs. This will provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the membership increase after 12 months.

# **[atomic_06_01]**
# 
# To begin, I need to take the results of all the simulation runs and focus on the increase in membership compared to the initial number of members. This means that for each of the 10,000 simulations, I will calculate how much the membership has grown by subtracting the initial membership from the final membership count after 12 months.

# **[atomic_06_02]**
# 
# Once I have the membership increases from all simulations, the next step is to sort these increases. Sorting helps in identifying the distribution of the membership growth and allows us to compute percentiles. The 5th and 95th percentiles represent the range within which 90% of the membership increases fall. By calculating these percentiles, I can estimate the uncertainty in the gym’s growth and understand the possible variations in future membership.

# **[atomic_06_03]**
# 
# The sorted membership increases will allow me to extract the 5th and 95th percentiles. The 5th percentile indicates the lower bound of expected growth, while the 95th percentile shows the upper bound. This gives us a range where the true membership increase is likely to fall, with 90% confidence. This interval helps the gym make better decisions based on expected membership growth under uncertainty.

# **[atomic_06_04]**
# 
# Here’s how I can compute the 90% confidence interval:
# 
# ```python
# def calculate_confidence_interval(results, initial_members):
#     # Calculate membership increase by subtracting initial members
#     increases = [result - initial_members for result in results]
#     
#     # Sort the increases to calculate percentiles
#     sorted_increases = np.sort(increases)
#     
#     # Extract the 5th and 95th percentiles
#     lower_bound = np.percentile(sorted_increases, 5)
#     upper_bound = np.percentile(sorted_increases, 95)
#     
#     return lower_bound, upper_bound
# ```
# 
# With the 90% confidence interval calculated, I can move forward to validate the correctness of the simulation by writing unit tests for each component.

# ---

# **[SECTION_07]**
# 
# In this section, I will implement unit tests for the simulation components to ensure everything is working as expected. Unit tests will verify that the retention probabilities, referral logic, and new member additions are functioning correctly.

# **[atomic_07_01]**
# 
# Unit testing is crucial to ensure that each part of the simulation behaves as expected. For instance, I need to verify that the retention logic works correctly, meaning that members attending 1-2 classes per week have a 60% chance of staying, while those attending 3+ classes have an 80% chance. I’ll write tests to ensure the probabilities are applied correctly, and the retention and dropout logic is working as expected.

# **[atomic_07_02]**
# 
# Next, I need to test the referral mechanism. I want to make sure that 10% of the current members are referring new members each month. The test will check if the correct number of referrals is generated based on the current membership. Additionally, I will test the addition of 5 fixed new members every month to ensure that this fixed growth is applied consistently, independent of referrals.

# **[atomic_07_03]**
# 
# To ensure that the entire simulation behaves correctly and can be reproduced, I will use a fixed random seed for the tests. This ensures that the random processes, such as retention probabilities and dropout events, will yield the same results every time the tests are run. This guarantees the reproducibility of the tests and helps ensure accuracy in verifying the components.

# **[atomic_07_04]**
# 
# Here’s an example of how I would write unit tests to verify the simulation components:
# 
# ```python
# def test_retention(self):
#     # Test retention for members attending 1-2 classes with 60% probability
#     members = ["member1", "member2", "member3", "member4"]
#     retained_members = simulate_retention(members, attendance_type="1-2")
#     self.assertGreater(len(retained_members), 0)  # Ensure some members are retained
#     self.assertLess(len(retained_members), len(members))  # Ensure not all members stay
#     
# def test_new_members_addition(self):
#     # Test that 5 new members are added each month
#     initial_members = 100
#     new_members = add_new_members(["member1", "member2", "member3"])
#     self.assertEqual(new_members, 15)  # 10% of 3 members (0) + 5 new fixed members
# 
# def test_random_seed(self):
#     # Test reproducibility using a fixed random seed
#     random.seed(42)
#     members = ["member1", "member2", "member3"]
#     retained_members = simulate_retention(members, attendance_type="3+")
#     self.assertEqual(len(retained_members), 2)  # Check if the same outcome is reproduced
# ```
# 
# By running these tests, I can validate that all components of the simulation work correctly and ensure the reliability of the simulation results.

# [RESPONSE]   
# 
# To solve this problem, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to model how gym membership changes over 12 months. We accounted for factors such as member retention, natural dropout, referrals, and new member additions. By running 10,000 simulations, we obtained a distribution of possible membership increases and calculated a 90% confidence interval to estimate the range of expected growth.  
# 
# 
# 
# ###  Step 1: Define Key Parameters   
# - Set initial membership at  100 members .  
# - Defined retention rates:  60%  for members attending  1-2 classes per week  and  80%  for those attending  3+ classes per week .  
# - Factored in a  2% dropout rate  per month.  
# - Included a  10% referral rate , meaning 10% of members refer at least one new member.  
# - Added a fixed  5 new members per month  regardless of referrals.  
# - Set the simulation to run over  12 months  with  10,000 Monte Carlo iterations .  
# 
# 
# 
# ###  Step 2: Model Member Retention & Dropout   
# - Each member's likelihood of staying is based on their attendance frequency.  
# - Retained members still face a  2% chance of dropping out  each month.  
# - This process is repeated each month to model long-term retention.  
# 
# 
# 
# ###  Step 3: Model Referrals & New Member Additions   
# - Every month,  10% of current members refer new members .  
# - The gym also gains  5 new members monthly  regardless of referrals.  
# - The total number of new members is the sum of referrals and fixed additions.  
# 
# 
# 
# ###  Step 4: Run the Simulation Over 12 Months   
# - Start with  100 members  and loop through each month.  
# - Apply  retention/dropout logic  to adjust member count.  
# - Add  new members from referrals and fixed additions .  
# - Repeat this process  10,000 times  to simulate different possible outcomes.  
# 
# 
# 
# ###  Step 5: Analyze Results & Calculate Confidence Interval   
# - After each simulation, record the  final membership  after 12 months.  
# - Compute the  increase in membership  by subtracting the initial 100 members.  
# - Sort the results and extract the  5th and 95th percentiles  to form a  90% confidence interval .

# 
# ###  Explanation   
# 
# -  **Input:**
#   - Initial members:  100   
#   - Simulation duration:  12 months   
#   - Monte Carlo iterations:  10,000   
#   - Retention, dropout, and referral rates as defined earlier.  
# 
# -  **Calculations & Reasoning:**   
#   - The simulation models individual retention/dropout probabilities.  
#   - New members are added each month based on referrals and fixed gains.  
#   - By running 10,000 iterations, we capture uncertainty and variability.  
#   - The confidence interval helps estimate the expected range of membership growth.  
# 
# -  **Output:**   
#   - The  90% confidence interval  for membership growth after 12 months provides an estimate of how much the gym's membership is likely to increase.  
# 
# This process provides a robust way to predict gym membership trends while accounting for uncertainty in retention and referral behavior.
