A train travelled at one‐third of its usual speed, and hence reached the destination 30 minutes after the scheduled time. On its return journey, the train initially travelled at its usual speed for 5 minutes but then stopped for 4 minutes for an emergency. The percentage by which the train must now increase its usual speed so as to reach the destination at the scheduled time, is nearest to

**[SECTION_01]**

I define the key variables—speed (V), distance (D), and time (T)—to establish a clear baseline for analysis. By showing how running at one-third the usual speed causes delays, I set up a framework to measure deviations from the scheduled travel time. This foundation ensures clarity in exploring outbound and return trips while supporting subsequent derivations.

**[atomic_01_01]**

I begin by defining the usual speed as V and the total distance between the stations as D. I set the scheduled travel time T as the quotient D/V, which establishes a clear relationship between distance, speed, and time. I ensure that I maintain consistency in the units of measurement throughout the problem.

**[atomic_01_02]**

I introduce the concept of the scheduled time T, which is calculated by dividing the distance D by the usual speed V. I make it clear that T represents the ideal travel duration if the train maintained its usual speed without interruptions. I explain that by establishing T = D/V, I create a benchmark against which delays and speed variations can be compared.

**[atomic_01_03]**

I now express the actual travel time when the train moves at one-third its usual speed. I note that the new speed becomes V/3, which leads to an actual time of 3D/V. I emphasize that this deviation from the scheduled speed is the core reason for the delay. By comparing the scheduled time T with the actual time 3D/V, I set the stage to analyze how a reduced speed impacts the travel time and contributes to a delay.

**[atomic_01_04]**

I articulate that the delay experienced by the train is the difference between the actual time taken at one-third speed and the scheduled time. Mathematically, this delay is represented as (3D/V) – (D/V). I make sure to highlight that this subtraction isolates the extra time incurred due to the reduced speed.

**[atomic_01_05]**

I then simplify the delay expression (3D/V) – (D/V) to obtain 2D/V. I stress that this expression now directly relates the delay to the known variables, offering a simplified equation that captures the impact of traveling at a reduced speed. I discuss how this simplified equation serves as a stepping stone for further calculations, as it allows me to quantitatively measure the additional time taken due to the slow speed.

**[atomic_01_06]**

I make a note of the fact that all times are considered in minutes for simplicity. By standardizing the units, I ensure that the calculations remain consistent throughout the analysis. I explain that this step is important because it prevents any confusion or misinterpretation of the results.

**[atomic_01_07]**

I observe that the relationship T = D/V is not only a definition but also an anchor for comparing different scenarios. I mention that by having a fixed scheduled time T, I can clearly see how deviations from the usual speed affect the travel time. This comparison is fundamental because it enables me to assess the impact of the reduced speed on the outbound journey and eventually determine the necessary adjustments for the return journey.

**[atomic_01_08]**

I finalize the setup by ensuring that all defined variables—V, D, and T—are now well established in my analysis. I state that with these definitions in place, I am prepared to move on to quantifying the delay experienced during the outbound journey.

---

**[SECTION_02]**

Using the 30-minute delay, I determine the scheduled journey time, \( T \). By equating the extra travel time to 30 minutes, I extract \( T \) by comparing the actual time at one-third speed with the scheduled time. This calculation sets a clear baseline for further comparisons, ensuring a precise mathematical approach to computing \( T \) and analyzing the return journey.

**[atomic_02_01]**

I start by noting that when the train travels at one-third its usual speed, the actual travel time becomes 3D/V. I compare this with the scheduled time T, which is D/V. I emphasize that the difference between these two times represents the extra delay incurred.

**[atomic_02_02]**

I clearly state that the extra time or delay due to the reduced speed is given by the expression (3D/V) – (D/V). I express my focus on this formula because it captures the core impact of traveling at a reduced speed. I describe how I use this difference to understand the proportional impact of speed reduction.

**[atomic_02_03]**

I simplify the expression (3D/V) – (D/V) to obtain 2D/V. I make it clear that this represents the additional time taken beyond the scheduled duration. I note that by simplifying the expression, I have isolated the factor that directly corresponds to the delay.

**[atomic_02_04]**

I set the simplified expression 2D/V equal to the known delay of 30 minutes. I explain that by doing so, I am able to derive a relationship between the distance D and the usual speed V. I highlight that equating 2D/V to 30 minutes allows me to compute D/V, which is critical since D/V represents the scheduled time T.

**[atomic_02_05]**

I solve the equation 2D/V = 30 minutes to obtain D/V = 15 minutes. I articulate that this result directly informs me that the scheduled travel time T is 15 minutes. I take care to explain how this derivation is both logical and necessary, as it not only provides the value of T but also solidifies the foundation for understanding the timing aspects of both the outbound and return journeys.

**[atomic_02_06]**

I interpret the result by emphasizing that the scheduled time of 15 minutes represents the ideal travel duration at the usual speed V, assuming no interruptions or delays. I make it clear that this ideal scenario serves as the benchmark against which any deviations will be measured.

**[atomic_02_07]**

I confirm that the derivation of T = 15 minutes is now complete, and I document the process for future reference. I explain that this step is essential because knowing the scheduled time allows me to calculate the remaining time available during the return journey after accounting for any delays or stoppages.

**[atomic_02_08]**

I conclude this section by summarizing that the derivation of the scheduled time is based on comparing the travel times at different speeds and equating the additional delay to 30 minutes. I ensure that I have a solid numerical value for T, which is 15 minutes, and I prepare to use this value in analyzing the return journey.

---

**[SECTION_03]**

With the scheduled time in hand, I analyze the outbound journey, where the train moves at one-third speed. I explore how this reduction causes a 30-minute delay, comparing expected and actual times. This analysis clarifies the connection between slower speed and increased travel time, providing essential context for understanding the issue.

**[atomic_03_01]**

I examine the outbound journey by noting that the train travels at one-third of its usual speed, which is V/3. I elaborate that by reducing the speed, the time required to cover the same distance increases significantly. I explain that this slower speed leads to an actual travel time of 3D/V.

**[atomic_03_02]**

I emphasize that the delayed travel time of 3D/V is critical because it directly contrasts with the scheduled time T, which is D/V. I articulate that the difference between these two times, represented as 3D/V – D/V, quantifies the impact of the reduced speed on the overall journey.

**[atomic_03_03]**

I observe that the difference between the actual travel time and the scheduled time simplifies to 2D/V. I detail how this mathematical simplification is not only elegant but also provides a direct measure of the delay in minutes. I stress that this step is vital because it converts the abstract relationship between speed and time into a tangible delay value.

**[atomic_03_04]**

I reflect on the significance of the computed delay 2D/V, which, after equating to 30 minutes, allowed me to derive that D/V equals 15 minutes. I explain that this revelation confirms the scheduled time of the journey, which is a key parameter in my analysis.

**[atomic_03_05]**

I note that the outbound journey analysis serves as a critical reference point. I point out that the extra time of 30 minutes clearly indicates the effect of reducing the speed to one-third of the usual value. I discuss that this analysis not only validates my initial assumptions but also sets up the groundwork for comparing the outbound and return journeys.

**[atomic_03_06]**

I articulate that by carefully analyzing the outbound journey, I gain insights into how speed variations directly translate into time delays. I underline the importance of this insight for subsequent calculations.

**[atomic_03_07]**

I explain that the detailed examination of the outbound journey’s time dynamics is necessary for constructing a complete picture of the problem. I mention that the delay resulting from the reduced speed provides a measurable parameter that I can later use to adjust the return journey.

**[atomic_03_06]**

I conclude my analysis of the outbound journey by reaffirming that the extra 30 minutes delay results from traveling at one-third of the usual speed. I state that this conclusion is a pivotal component of the problem, as it establishes the benchmark against which the return journey’s performance will be measured.

---

**[SECTION_04]**

After confirming the outbound delay, I now examine the return journey. I break down the first five minutes at normal speed and the next four minutes of stoppage within the 15-minute schedule. This clear timeline reveals the remaining time and sets the stage for any necessary speed adjustments.

**[atomic_04_01]**

I begin by noting that on the return journey, the train initially travels at its usual speed for 5 minutes. I elaborate that during these 5 minutes, the train covers a distance equal to 5V. I explain that this initial phase represents the part of the journey that is on schedule.

**[atomic_04_02]**

I describe that after the initial 5 minutes, the train stops for 4 minutes due to an emergency. I emphasize that this stoppage is significant because it consumes valuable time that could otherwise be used for travel. I elaborate on how this stoppage interrupts the journey and contributes directly to a reduction in the available time to cover the remaining distance.

**[atomic_04_03]**

I analyze the combined effect of the 5-minute travel period and the 4-minute stoppage. I calculate that these events together take 9 minutes, which directly subtracts from the total scheduled travel time of 15 minutes. I explain that this means only 6 minutes remain for covering the rest of the journey.

**[atomic_04_04]**

I reflect on the fact that the 4-minute stoppage is a fixed delay that I cannot recover by any means other than speeding up later. I elaborate on how this stoppage introduces a rigid constraint on the time available for the return journey. I state that acknowledging this stoppage as a non-negotiable delay is essential for calculating the necessary speed increase.

**[atomic_04_05]**

I underscore that the return journey’s breakdown into distinct segments—5 minutes of normal travel and 4 minutes of stoppage—is critical for my subsequent calculations. I detail that this segmentation allows me to precisely quantify the available travel time remaining, which is 6 minutes

**[atomic_04_06]**

I emphasize that by understanding the precise durations of travel and stoppage, I can now focus on the distance that remains to be covered after the initial 5 minutes. I articulate that the initial segment at the usual speed sets a clear benchmark for how much distance is already covered, while the stoppage creates a deficit that must be compensated for.

**[atomic_04_07]**

I clarify that the breakdown of the return journey is not only about measuring time but also about understanding the interplay between distance and time. I explain that by isolating the time segments, I can later derive how the remaining distance must be managed within a shorter period.

**[atomic_04_08]**

I conclude this section by confirming that after 5 minutes of travel at the usual speed and a 4-minute stoppage, I have exactly 6 minutes remaining to cover the rest of the journey. I state that this realization sets a firm foundation for my subsequent calculations, as I now know both the time deficit and the distance that must be covered in this constrained period.

---

**[SECTION_05]**

With 5 minutes at normal speed and 4 minutes idle, I confirm 10V of distance remains with only 6 minutes left, determining the required speed increase. I then calculate the remaining journey in terms of V, linking the distance covered to the remaining gap and identifying the emergency’s time deficit.

**[atomic_05_01]**

I start by determining the distance covered during the initial 5 minutes at the usual speed. I articulate that the train covers a distance equal to 5V during this period. I emphasize that by knowing this distance, I can compute the remaining distance by subtracting 5V from the total distance D.

**[atomic_05_02]**

I recall that I previously derived the scheduled time T as 15 minutes and that the total distance D can be expressed as 15V. I explain that this expression for D is critical because it ties the distance directly to the usual speed and the scheduled travel time. I then articulate that by using D = 15V, I have a clear numerical relationship that I can leverage to calculate the remaining distance after the initial 5 minutes.

**[atomic_05_03]**

I compute the remaining distance by subtracting the distance already covered (5V) from the total distance (15V). I express this as 15V – 5V, which simplifies to 10V. I stress that this computation is straightforward yet fundamental, as it quantifies exactly how much distance the train must cover in the final leg of the return journey.

**[atomic_05_04]**

I then focus on the time available to cover this remaining distance. I recall that after accounting for the 5 minutes of travel and the 4 minutes of stoppage, only 6 minutes remain. I articulate that this 6-minute window is the critical time constraint within which the train must cover the remaining 10V distance.

**[atomic_05_05]**

I emphasize that the remaining distance of 10V and the available time of 6 minutes are now clearly defined parameters for my analysis. I articulate that by having both these values explicitly, I can now form an equation that links the two. I state that this relationship will be key in determining the required factor by which the usual speed must be increased.

**[atomic_05_06]**

I explain that my next step will be to derive an equation relating the remaining distance, the increased speed factor, and the available time. I note that with the remaining distance being 10V and the available time being 6 minutes, I can set up the equation in a manner that directly solves for the new speed factor.

**[atomic_05_07]**

I articulate that I now have all the necessary components to derive the new speed requirement. I emphasize that the defined values—10V for the remaining distance and 6 minutes for the available time—are both expressed in consistent units.

**[atomic_05_08]**

I conclude this section by confirming that I have accurately determined both the remaining distance to be 10V and the available time to be 6 minutes. I state that these calculations are crucial for setting up the equation that will allow me to compute the required increase in speed.

---

**[SECTION_06]**

Knowing I must cover 10V in 6 minutes, I compute the multiplier k to boost the usual speed. By linking distance, time, and speed, I isolate the exact factor needed to offset the outbound delay and emergency stoppage, setting up an equation to determine the required adjustment.

**[atomic_06_01]**

I set up an equation where the new speed is represented as kV, with k being the factor by which the usual speed is increased. I articulate that to cover the remaining distance of 10V in 6 minutes, the time taken would be expressed as (10V)/(kV). I emphasize that this ratio simplifies to 10/k, which represents the time in minutes required at the increased speed.

**[atomic_06_02]**

I equate the expression 10/k to the available 6 minutes. I explain that setting 10/k equal to 6 minutes is a logical step, as it forces the equation to reflect the actual time available to cover the remaining distance. I discuss how this step is central to isolating k and ensuring that the new speed is exactly what is needed to meet the schedule.

**[atomic_06_03]**

I solve the equation 10/k = 6 by cross-multiplying, which yields k = 10/6. I articulate that simplifying this fraction gives k = 5/3, which is approximately 1.667. I stress that this value of k represents the factor by which the usual speed must be increased.

**[atomic_06_04]**

I ensure that I reflect on the meaning of k = 5/3. I explain that this means the train must now travel at 5/3 times its usual speed to cover the remaining distance in the available 6 minutes. I articulate that this increased speed compensates for both the delay caused by the reduced speed on the outbound journey and the stoppage on the return journey.

**[atomic_06_05]**

I detail the importance of maintaining consistency in units when solving for k. I note that since V cancels out in the equation, the factor k is dimensionless. I explain that this property is advantageous because it allows me to express the required increase in speed purely as a multiplier, independent of the actual value of V.

**[atomic_06_06]**

I reflect on the mathematical elegance of deriving k from the relationship 10/k = 6. I describe how the equation neatly encapsulates the constraints imposed by the remaining distance and time. I ensure that I express satisfaction in reaching a clear value for k, as it transforms the problem into one that is immediately interpretable in practical terms.

**[atomic_06_07]**

I articulate that with k computed as 5/3, I now have a firm numerical basis to determine the percentage increase in speed. I stress that this intermediate result is both intuitive and essential, as it directly informs the next step—calculating the percentage by which the usual speed must be increased.

**[atomic_06_08]**

I conclude this section by confirming that the required speed increase factor is 5/3, or approximately 1.667. I state that this result means the train must travel at 1.667 times its usual speed to cover the remaining distance in the allotted time.

---

**[SECTION_07]**

Next, I convert the computed speed factor into a percentage to determine how much faster the train must travel. By turning the abstract ratio (5/3) into a clear value, I precisely show the required speed increase for on-time arrival.

**[atomic_07_01]**

I express the new speed as kV, where k is 5/3 from my previous calculations. I explain that to find the percentage increase, I subtract the original speed V from the new speed kV, yielding (kV – V). I articulate that this difference represents the additional speed required over the usual speed.

**[atomic_07_02]**

I then calculate the value of (k – 1). I detail that since k is 5/3, (k – 1) becomes (5/3 – 1), which simplifies to 2/3. I emphasize that this fraction, 2/3, directly represents the increase over the usual speed relative to V.

**[atomic_07_03]**

I proceed to convert the fractional increase into a percentage. I articulate that multiplying the fraction 2/3 by 100 yields the percentage increase. I detail that (2/3) × 100 equals approximately 66.67%. I stress that this conversion is the final step in the computation, turning a dimensionless multiplier into a percentage that is easily interpretable in a real-world context.

**[atomic_07_04]**

I highlight that the result of approximately 66.67% represents the additional speed required on the return journey. I explain that this percentage quantifies how much faster the train must travel compared to its usual speed to make up for the delays incurred.

**[atomic_07_05]**

I reflect on the clarity of the derived percentage, noting that expressing the result as 66.67% provides an intuitive understanding of the necessary adjustment. I mention that this percentage increase makes the abstract concept of a speed factor tangible and actionable.

**[atomic_07_06]**

I consider the rounding of the percentage value, noting that rounding 66.67% to the nearest whole number gives approximately 67%. I emphasize that this rounded figure is sufficiently precise for practical purposes, and it encapsulates the solution in a neat and understandable form.

**[atomic_07_07]**

I articulate that by converting the speed factor into a percentage, I have effectively completed the key calculation required by the problem. I stress that this percentage increase is both the final numerical answer and the practical solution to the problem.

**[atomic_07_08]**

I conclude this section by reaffirming that the train must increase its usual speed by approximately 67%. I summarize that this conclusion comes from the systematic derivation of the speed factor and its conversion into a percentage.

---

**[SECTION_08]**

I now tie everything together—from establishing the baseline travel time to calculating the necessary speed boost. Reviewing the outbound delay, emergency stop, and final acceleration confirms that a 67% increase corrects the schedule. I succinctly summarize the derivation, analysis, and required speed increase.

**[atomic_08_01]**

I begin by recapping the problem, noting that the train traveled at one-third its usual speed on the outbound journey, resulting in a 30-minute delay. I explain that this delay allowed me to derive the scheduled time of 15 minutes.

**[atomic_08_02]**

I review the analysis of the outbound journey, where I compared the actual travel time at reduced speed with the scheduled time. I stress that this comparison led to the simplified expression 2D/V, which, when equated to the 30-minute delay, allowed me to determine that the scheduled travel time is 15 minutes.

**[atomic_08_03]**

I summarize the breakdown of the return journey, highlighting that the train traveled at its usual speed for 5 minutes and then stopped for 4 minutes. I articulate that these events consumed 9 minutes, leaving only 6 minutes to cover the remaining distance.

**[atomic_08_04]**

I reiterate that I calculated the remaining distance to be 10V by subtracting the distance covered in the initial 5 minutes from the total distance of 15V. I emphasize that by expressing the remaining distance in terms of V, I maintained consistency in my analysis.

**[atomic_08_05]**

I review the computation of the required speed increase factor, where I set up the equation 10/k = 6 and solved for k, obtaining 5/3. I explain that this factor means the train must travel at 1.667 times its usual speed.

**[atomic_08_06]**

I then recapitulate the conversion of the speed factor into a percentage increase. I describe how I derived that (5/3 – 1) equals 2/3, which when multiplied by 100 yields approximately 66.67%. I emphasize that rounding this result to the nearest whole number gives a final required speed increase of 67%.

**[atomic_08_07]**

I reflect on the entire process, noting that every step—from defining the variables to breaking down the journey and solving the equations—has been conducted systematically and in a logical sequence. I state that the clarity of each phase of the analysis has ensured that the final answer is well-founded and precise.

**[atomic_08_08]**

I conclude this final section by affirming that the train must increase its usual speed by approximately 67% on the return journey in order to reach the destination at the scheduled time. I summarize that this answer encapsulates all the derivations and logical reasoning steps that I have presented.

---

**[RESPONSE]**

After careful and systematic analysis of the train scheduling problem, I conclude that the train must increase its usual speed by approximately 67% on its return journey in order to arrive at the destination on time. I reached this conclusion by first establishing the scheduled time from the outbound delay, then breaking down the return journey into its components (normal travel and stoppage), computing the remaining distance and available time, and finally determining the necessary speed factor and its corresponding percentage increase. The detailed steps below summarize my reasoning:

### STEP 1: Problem Overview and Variable Setup
- I start by defining the usual speed as V and the total distance between stations as D. I state that the scheduled travel time T is given by D/V. I set up the problem with the understanding that when the train travels at one-third of V, the actual time becomes 3D/V, which leads directly to the delay. I introduce these basic variables to create a firm foundation for subsequent derivations and ensure that all time and distance relationships are consistently maintained.
- I clarify that V represents the train’s normal operating speed and that D is the total distance to be covered. I emphasize that T = D/V serves as the ideal scenario time, setting a benchmark for comparing delayed and adjusted journeys. I note that the problem’s conditions force me to derive T by comparing the actual time taken at a reduced speed to the scheduled time. This definition underpins all later calculations regarding delays and speed adjustments.
- I mention that I am considering all times in minutes for ease of calculation, which aids in clear interpretation of delays and speed factors. I make sure that the use of these variables will remain consistent throughout the analysis. I stress that having these clear definitions early on is critical, as they form the basis upon which I will compare the effects of speed reduction and later compute the required increase.
- I introduce the idea that the train’s speed is reduced to V/3 during the outbound journey, which increases the travel time significantly. I explain that this change in speed is directly responsible for the additional delay observed. I underscore that understanding this speed reduction is the first step in quantifying the effect on travel time and ultimately in determining the compensatory increase needed later.
- I assert that the relationship between distance, speed, and time (T = D/V) is fundamental, and I document that any deviation from the scheduled conditions must be expressed in terms of these variables. I note that using these variables, I can isolate the effect of the delay and properly quantify the impact of both the reduced speed and the stoppage in subsequent sections.
- I detail that the scheduled travel time T is crucial not only for understanding the outbound delay but also for setting the parameters of the return journey. I stress that establishing these initial variables gives me a clear reference for all future computations. I indicate that this approach ensures consistency in my derivations and that I can accurately compare the expected and actual performance of the train.
- I observe that having a precise value for T is essential to determine the remaining time available on the return journey after delays. I emphasize that this clarity in variable definition reduces ambiguity later when calculating the necessary speed adjustments. I note that by starting with these variables, I am ensuring that every part of the problem is measured against a well-defined standard.
- I conclude this section by confirming that I have successfully established the key variables—V, D, and T—which will now serve as the pillars of my analysis. I affirm that this initial setup is vital for all subsequent steps, providing a reliable framework for assessing the impact of speed changes and delays on the overall schedule.

### STEP 2: Derivation of Scheduled Time
- I begin by examining the scenario where the train travels at one-third its usual speed (V/3), which results in an actual travel time of 3D/V. I articulate that the delay incurred is the difference between the actual time and the scheduled time T, expressed as 3D/V – D/V. I focus on this equation because it directly quantifies how the reduced speed contributes to a delay in the journey.
- I simplify the expression for the delay, noting that 3D/V – D/V becomes 2D/V. I emphasize that this equation represents the extra time taken due to the reduced speed. I stress that isolating this term is critical, as it allows me to equate the delay with the known 30 minutes, thereby providing a direct method to compute the scheduled time T.
- I set the equation 2D/V equal to 30 minutes, which encapsulates the condition that the train arrives 30 minutes late. I explain that this equality is the key to deriving the value of D/V. I note that by solving 2D/V = 30, I obtain D/V = 15 minutes, which immediately tells me that the scheduled time T is 15 minutes.
- I elaborate that the scheduled time T = 15 minutes is derived from the relation D/V = 15. I stress that this derivation is crucial because it provides a benchmark for comparing both the outbound delay and the adjustments needed on the return journey. I indicate that this result will now be used to frame the timing issues in the return trip.
- I emphasize that equating 2D/V to 30 minutes ties the abstract variables D and V to a concrete time measure. I point out that this step not only validates the delay but also provides a clear numerical reference for T. I ensure that I document this value carefully as it forms the basis of all subsequent calculations.
- I note that the derivation of T also confirms the proportional relationship between speed reduction and delay. I explain that the 30-minute delay is entirely due to the train operating at V/3, and this fact reinforces the mathematical relationship I have established. I underline that this understanding is vital as I move on to analyze the return journey.
- I assert that this derivation of T = 15 minutes is both logical and necessary for the problem. I stress that without a precise value for T, I would not be able to accurately determine the remaining time or the necessary adjustments. I mention that the clarity of this derivation gives me confidence in the subsequent steps of the analysis.
- I conclude this section by summarizing that I have derived the scheduled time T as 15 minutes, based solely on the delay caused by the one-third speed operation. I affirm that this value is now firmly established and ready to be used for further analysis of the return journey’s timing and speed requirements.

### STEP 3: Outbound Journey Analysis
- I now analyze the outbound journey where the train travels at one-third of its usual speed, which results in an actual travel time of 3D/V. I articulate that this slower speed is the main reason for the 30-minute delay. I detail that comparing 3D/V with the scheduled time T (D/V) clearly shows how the reduced speed triples the travel time, creating the additional delay that I must account for in my analysis.
- I discuss how the difference in time, computed as 3D/V – D/V, quantifies the impact of the reduced speed. I note that this difference simplifies to 2D/V, which is directly equated to 30 minutes. I explain that this comparison is essential because it isolates the effect of speed reduction on the travel time, providing a direct measure of the delay experienced by the train.
- I reflect on the fact that the outbound journey’s delay is solely due to the train operating at V/3. I elaborate that this condition not only increases the travel time but also serves as a key indicator of how performance deviates from the schedule. I stress that understanding this deviation is crucial for setting up the later calculations that determine the necessary compensatory speed increase.
- I emphasize that by analyzing the outbound journey, I establish that the train’s slower speed causes a delay proportional to 2D/V. I detail that this relationship is the cornerstone of my timing analysis. I underline that having a clear understanding of how the reduced speed translates into delay gives me a firm basis for comparing with the return journey dynamics.
- I observe that the delay of 30 minutes, derived from the reduced speed scenario, is a measurable parameter that directly impacts the overall journey. I note that this measurable delay provides the numerical anchor needed to compute the scheduled time T, which I already derived as 15 minutes. I state that this insight confirms the consistency of the problem’s parameters.
- I articulate that my analysis of the outbound journey not only validates the effect of reduced speed but also prepares me for examining the return journey, where additional delays occur due to stoppage. I stress that this comparison is vital as it highlights the need for a compensatory increase in speed on the return leg.
- I indicate that the outbound analysis confirms that any deviation from the usual speed significantly alters the travel time. I note that the delay measured here will serve as a reference for assessing the impact of the emergency stoppage on the return journey. I emphasize that this understanding is critical for formulating the speed adjustment strategy.
- I conclude this section by reaffirming that the outbound journey analysis has shown how operating at V/3 results in a 30-minute delay, establishing the key relationship 2D/V = 30 minutes and reinforcing the scheduled time T = 15 minutes for further use in my overall analysis.

### STEP 4: Return Journey Breakdown
- I break down the return journey by first noting that the train travels at its usual speed V for 5 minutes. I explain that during these 5 minutes, the train covers a distance of 5V. I emphasize that this segment of the journey occurs on schedule and sets the stage for analyzing what happens next, as it provides a measure of progress before any delays or stoppages affect the timing.
- I describe that after the initial 5 minutes, the train stops for 4 minutes due to an emergency. I articulate that this stoppage is critical because it consumes valuable time that could otherwise be used to cover distance. I stress that understanding the impact of this 4-minute stoppage is essential, as it directly reduces the available time to complete the journey, forcing a compensatory increase in speed later.
- I note that the total time allotted for the journey, as derived earlier, is 15 minutes. I explain that by subtracting the 5 minutes of travel and the 4 minutes of stoppage, I am left with 6 minutes to cover the remaining distance. I emphasize that this calculation of available time is crucial, as it directly determines the constraints for the speed adjustment needed on the return journey.
- I detail that the segmentation of the return journey into 5 minutes of travel and 4 minutes of stoppage gives me a clear timeline. I explain that this breakdown is essential for isolating the portion of the journey that is affected by the emergency and quantifying the resultant time deficit. I stress that having a precise timeline allows me to accurately compute the required increase in speed to cover the remaining distance.
- I assert that the 4-minute stoppage is non-recoverable and must be compensated for entirely by increasing speed in the remaining 6 minutes. I articulate that this stoppage introduces a fixed delay that critically impacts the overall schedule. I note that understanding this delay’s exact duration is essential for formulating the equation that will determine the necessary speed factor.
- I clarify that the return journey analysis must incorporate both the 5 minutes of on-schedule travel and the 4 minutes lost to the emergency. I emphasize that these distinct phases provide a complete picture of the journey’s timing, ensuring that I capture all elements affecting the schedule. I highlight that this comprehensive breakdown is key to setting up the later calculations.
- I reflect on how the clear demarcation of travel time versus stoppage time allows me to pinpoint the exact time available for the final leg of the journey. I note that this understanding is vital for computing how much faster the train must travel. I stress that by isolating the 6 minutes of available time, I can now precisely target the speed increase calculation.
- I conclude this section by confirming that the return journey is effectively segmented into an initial 5-minute travel phase, a 4-minute stoppage, and a final 6-minute period to cover the remaining distance. I affirm that this breakdown lays the groundwork for computing the necessary adjustments to the train’s speed to meet the scheduled time.

### STEP 5: Calculation of Remaining Distance and Available Time
- I calculate the remaining distance on the return journey by first noting that the total distance D equals 15V, as derived from T = 15 minutes. I explain that the distance covered in the initial 5 minutes is 5V, leaving a remaining distance of 15V – 5V, which simplifies to 10V. I stress that expressing the remaining distance in terms of V maintains consistency with my earlier definitions.
- I emphasize that with 10V as the remaining distance, I now have a concrete measure to work with. I detail that the remaining time available, after accounting for the 5 minutes of travel and 4 minutes of stoppage, is 6 minutes. I point out that these figures (10V and 6 minutes) are critical inputs for the next calculation, where I will determine the speed factor required to cover the remaining distance.
- I articulate that the remaining 10V must be covered in 6 minutes, which sets up a clear relationship between distance and time for the final leg of the journey. I explain that this relationship is essential for computing the new required speed. I underline that having both the remaining distance and the available time precisely quantified is a necessary step before solving for the speed increase factor.
- I note that expressing both the remaining distance and the available time in terms of V and minutes respectively simplifies the formulation of the equation. I stress that this clarity allows me to set up a direct ratio between the distance to be covered and the time available. I highlight that this step bridges the gap between the problem’s physical constraints and the mathematical expression of the speed increase.
- I clarify that the remaining distance of 10V and the available time of 6 minutes serve as the primary parameters for formulating the speed adjustment equation. I explain that these parameters encapsulate the challenge of covering a fixed distance within a compressed time frame, necessitating a speed increase.
- I indicate that by having a precise measure of 10V for the distance and 6 minutes for the time, I can now derive a formula for the new speed required. I stress that this derivation is essential for the overall solution, as it will lead directly to the computation of the necessary multiplier k for the usual speed.
- I explain that these derived values provide a consistent and measurable framework for the final calculations. I note that the clarity in these numbers allows me to avoid any ambiguity in the subsequent mathematical steps, ensuring that I am accurately addressing the time deficit.
- I conclude this section by reaffirming that I have accurately determined both the remaining distance as 10V and the available time as 6 minutes. I confirm that these values are now ready to be used in the equation that will yield the required speed increase factor.

### STEP 6: Computation of Required Speed Factor
- I set up the equation for the new speed by letting the increased speed be represented as kV, where k is the factor I need to determine. I state that to cover the remaining distance of 10V in 6 minutes, the time required is given by 10V/(kV), which simplifies to 10/k minutes. I emphasize that this relationship directly links the speed factor k to the time constraint, forming the basis for solving for k.
- I then equate the expression 10/k to the available 6 minutes, establishing the equation 10/k = 6. I articulate that this equation reflects the condition necessary to meet the scheduled time. I stress that solving this equation will give me the precise factor by which the usual speed must be increased, ensuring that the remaining distance is covered in the shortened time period.
- I solve the equation by cross-multiplying to obtain k = 10/6, which simplifies to 5/3. I note that 5/3 is approximately 1.667. I explain that this factor means the train must travel at 1.667 times its usual speed to compensate for the delays experienced during the outbound journey and the emergency stoppage on the return journey.
- I reflect on the significance of obtaining k = 5/3, noting that this dimensionless factor directly quantifies the necessary speed increase. I state that this value is critical because it encapsulates the relationship between the remaining distance and the available time, thus serving as the foundation for determining the percentage increase in speed.
- I emphasize that the cancellation of V in the ratio confirms that the factor k is independent of the actual speed, relying solely on the proportional changes in time and distance. I discuss that this property simplifies the problem significantly, allowing me to focus solely on the multiplier effect.
- I assert that the computed factor of 5/3 confirms that the train must run significantly faster during the final leg of the journey. I explain that this result logically follows from the compressed time available, which forces a substantial speed increase to cover the remaining distance.
- I clarify that every step in deriving k has been carefully validated by ensuring that the units and relationships are consistent. I note that this careful derivation instills confidence in the resulting value of k, as it directly arises from the precise constraints of the problem.
- I conclude this section by affirming that the required speed factor is k = 5/3 (approximately 1.667). I state that this value is now ready to be converted into a percentage increase over the usual speed, which will yield the final answer.

### STEP 7: Determination of Percentage Increase
- I express the new speed as kV, with k = 5/3, and I note that the increase in speed is given by (kV – V), which simplifies to (k – 1)V. I explain that this difference represents the extra speed needed over the usual speed, and converting it into a percentage involves comparing (k – 1) to 1.
- I calculate k – 1 by subtracting 1 from 5/3, obtaining 2/3. I articulate that this fraction, 2/3, signifies the proportional increase in speed relative to V. I stress that expressing the increase as a fraction of the original speed is essential for converting the result into a percentage.
- I multiply the fraction 2/3 by 100 to convert it into a percentage, yielding approximately 66.67%. I explain that this percentage represents the additional speed required on the return journey. I note that this value is the precise increase needed for the train to make up for the delay.
- I reflect on the practical meaning of a 66.67% increase, stating that it implies the train must operate nearly 67% faster than its usual speed. I stress that such a significant increase is necessary to cover the remaining distance in the drastically reduced available time.
- I articulate that rounding the value of 66.67% to the nearest whole number gives a final answer of 67%. I emphasize that this rounded value is appropriate for practical applications and clearly communicates the required speed adjustment.
- I note that converting the factor into a percentage makes the result immediately understandable in real-world terms. I explain that the percentage increase is a standard way of expressing how much faster the train must travel relative to its usual speed.
- I underscore that this step conclusively ties the mathematical derivation to an operational directive, ensuring that the calculated percentage increase directly informs the required speed adjustment.
- I conclude this section by affirming that the train must increase its usual speed by approximately 67%, which is the final, practical solution to the problem.

### STEP 8: Final Summary and Conclusion
- I recap the overall problem by stating that the train traveled at one-third its usual speed on the outbound journey, leading to a 30-minute delay, and on the return journey, a 5-minute normal travel period followed by a 4-minute stoppage left only 6 minutes to cover the remaining distance. I emphasize that these conditions necessitated a speed increase.
- I summarize that by establishing the scheduled time as 15 minutes and computing the remaining distance as 10V, I set up an equation for the new speed factor k. I note that solving 10/k = 6 minutes led me to k = 5/3, which is crucial for determining the speed adjustment.
- I reiterate that the increased speed is expressed as kV, where k = 5/3, meaning the train must operate at approximately 1.667 times its usual speed during the final leg of the journey. I stress that this factor directly translates into a measurable increase.
- I restate that converting the speed factor into a percentage increase results in (5/3 – 1) × 100%, which equals roughly 66.67%. I clarify that rounding this figure gives a final speed increase of 67%.
- I reflect on the logical progression of my analysis, noting that each step from defining variables to breaking down the journey has been systematically derived. I express that every calculation confirms the necessity for a significant speed boost.
- I emphasize that the clarity in every derivation ensures the accuracy of the final result. I confirm that the relationships between time, distance, and speed were maintained consistently throughout the problem.
- I note that the comprehensive breakdown of both the outbound and return journeys has led to a robust understanding of the time constraints involved. I stress that this detailed analysis provides confidence in the computed percentage increase.
- I conclude by stating that the train must increase its usual speed by approximately 67% on its return journey to reach the destination at the scheduled time, which is the final answer to the problem.


### Explanation
- **Input**: I begin with the problem statement where the train travels at one-third its usual speed on the outbound journey, resulting in a 30-minute delay. On the return journey, the train operates at its usual speed for 5 minutes before stopping for 4 minutes due to an emergency, leaving only 6 minutes to cover the remaining distance. The problem asks for the percentage increase in the train’s usual speed required to arrive on schedule.

- **Calculations and Reasoning**: I represent the usual speed as V and the total distance as D, so the scheduled time is T = D/V. When the train travels at V/3, its actual travel time becomes 3D/V, causing a delay given by 3D/V – D/V = 2D/V. Equating 2D/V to 30 minutes yields D/V = 15 minutes, so T = 15 minutes. For the return journey, after 5 minutes of travel (covering 5V) and a 4-minute stoppage, only 6 minutes remain to cover the remaining distance of 15V – 5V = 10V. Setting the equation 10V/(kV) = 6 minutes, I solve for k and find k = 10/6 = 5/3. The increase in speed is (5/3 – 1) = 2/3, which converts to a percentage increase of (2/3) × 100 ≈ 66.67%, or approximately 67% when rounded.

- **Output**: After a systematic derivation using the given conditions and mathematical relationships, I conclude that the train must increase its usual speed by approximately 67% on its return journey to reach the destination at the scheduled time.
